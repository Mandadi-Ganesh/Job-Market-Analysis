# Job Market Analysis - Machine Learning Project

### Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze job market trends using machine learning techniques. By leveraging various features such as job-related attributes and transaction data, we extract meaningful insights and build predictive models to understand job market dynamics.

### Dataset Description:
The dataset comprises multiple key attributes that influence job market trends. The primary features include:
* Job Title: The role or designation in the industry.  
* Industry: The sector in which the job falls (e.g., IT, Finance, Healthcare).  
* Salary: Estimated salary range for the role.  
* Location: The geographical area of the job.  
* skills Required: Key technical and soft skills necessary for the job.
* Other relevant job-related features

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Before applying clustering, we conduct *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* to understand patterns and correlations in the dataset.  

*Correlation Heatmap: Reveals relationships between numerical features to identify highly correlated variables.

*Pairplot: Displays pairwise relationships, helping in feature selection and distribution understanding.

### How the Project Works

#### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing:

1)Handling missing values and outliers.

2)Encoding categorical features where necessary.

3)Scaling numerical data to standardize input features.

#### 2️⃣ Model Training:

The project explores multiple clustering techniques to segment job market trends:

* K-Means Clustering: Groups data into predefined clusters based on feature similarity.

* Agglomerative Clustering: Uses hierarchical clustering to form nested clusters.

* DBSCAN: A density-based clustering algorithm to detect job market segments with arbitrary shapes.

#### 3️⃣Evaluation and Insights:

Model performance is assessed using silhouette scores and inertia (for K-Means).

K-Means outperformed other clustering models, achieving the highest Silhouette Score (0.4864).

Visualization of clustered job market segments to derive actionable insights.


### Key Insights:

The correlation heatmap highlighted key relationships between features, aiding feature selection.

K-Means was the best-performing clustering model, achieving the highest Silhouette Score (0.4864).

The clustering models effectively segmented job market data, revealing hidden patterns.

### Conclusion:

This project successfully leveraged machine learning and data analysis techniques to explore job market trends. K-Means clustering provided the most effective segmentation, making it a valuable tool for job market analysis. The insights obtained can assist policymakers, recruiters, and job seekers in making data-driven decisions.
